Description of the genomes:

VDAG_Jr2_v4.0.NCBIorder.fasta.masked.TElonger400: genome with only repeats shorter than 400 are masked
VDAG_Jr2_v4.0.NCBIorder.fasta.masked: all repeats are masked
VDAG_Jr2_v4.0.NCBIorder.fasta: unmasked genome

In the gtf folder are located all the annotations generated for V. dahliae strain JR2. Additionally, there are the different masked genome version. In the gtf folder there are gtf from the different software used and 3 subfolders which contains LoReAn annotation based on the level of masking of the genome

In the folder introns, there are the files used for the intron analysis while the orthomcl folder contains the data for the orthomcl analysis
